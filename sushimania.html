    <h3>How to Choose Fresh Fish for Sushi</h3>
 </div>
 <div class="paragraph">
    <div class="text">
 <p>In the 21st century, Japanese cuisine has gained popularity all over the world. The recipe has remained unchanged for a millennium, but thanks to the conservationist policies of the Land of the Rising Sun, this dish spread relatively recently. As part of a historical digression, it is useful to know: was the same type of fish used back then to prepare sushi as today? Yes, the same. The most common types of fish used for making rolls are:</p>
 <ul>
    <li>Carp</li>
    <li>Somon</li>
    <li>Tuna</li>
 </ul>
 <img src="images/sushi.gif" alt="Fish" class="fish">
  <p>Many people are interested in how dangerous it is to eat these types of fish raw. Experts say that, in moderation, such a product will not cause stomach problems and will be incredibly beneficial for the body. The thing is that raw fish contains an immense amount of nutrients that are lost as the products are processed. Therefore, you can eat it, but remember — everything is good in moderation.
However, there is also an opposing opinion: eating raw fish is dangerous. Supporters of this viewpoint suggest opening the reference book <em>“Parasites of Salmon Fish.”</em> <br>The book describes in detail what consuming unprocessed products can lead to, which may seriously harm your health. Therefore, do not rush to feast on raw salmon, tuna, or eel.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>The question of which type of fish to use in sushi or rolls is relevant for two reasons. First, many people have already learned how to prepare this Japanese dish at home. Some food enthusiasts are hesitant to eat sushi with certain types of fish due to taste preferences or allergic reactions.<br><br>Traditionally, Japanese sushi and rolls are made exclusively with salmon, tuna, and eel. There is some truth to this. Differences in taste between sushi or rolls offered in Japanese restaurants and local establishments exist, but they are minimal. The reason is product processing, the need to freeze or package them for transportation. <br><br>In the catering industry, only fish that is safe for health should be used, so helminths and pathogens are removed from them by various methods. This is achieved through heat treatment, which reduces the nutrient content. To avoid issues with sanitary inspections, the fish is marinated or salted. Under these conditions, the product is permitted in retail networks and public food services.

<br><br>We also recommend using only processed foods when preparing sushi and rolls. In this case, they will not cause health problems. Raw fish has more nutrients but carries a significant number of risks. Over millennia of evolution, the human body has adapted away from such foods, so there is no need to reinvent the wheel by filling rolls with raw ingredients. You can be confident that there are no serious taste differences between Japanese sushi and local versions.</p>

    <h3>Sushi vs Sashimi – What is the Difference?</h3>
    </div>
 <h4 class="subtitle reveal-glow">What is sushi?</h4>
 <div class="paragraph-sushi">
<div class="sushi-container">
    <div class="sushi-text">
<p>Sushi, one of the most iconic and beloved Japanese dishes, has captured the hearts and taste buds of food lovers around the world. Defined by its elegant simplicity and remarkable diversity, sushi is more than just food; it is an art, a tradition, and a way of life.<br><br>At its core, sushi represents a harmonious combination of cooked rice seasoned with rice vinegar and various toppings, most often raw fish or seafood, but also vegetables or even innovative variations with fruit.</p>
    <p><br><br>Sushi, as we know it today, has its origins in an ancient technique for preserving fish. In ancient Japan, people began to preserve fish by fermenting it with rice. This process, known as <em><strong>"narezushi"</strong></em>, was both a way to store food and a method of fermenting it, giving it a unique flavor. The fish was cleaned, salted, and then pressed between layers of rice and weights, allowing it to ferment for months. The fermented rice was then discarded, and the fish consumed.</p>

<h4 class="subtitle reveal-glow">What is sashimi?</h4>
<div class="paragraph-sashimi">
    <div class="sashimi-container">
        <div class="sashimi-text">
            <p><em>Sashimi</em> is a Japanese delicacy consisting of very fresh, raw meat or thin slices of fish. The word <em><strong>“sashimi”</strong></em> means <em><strong>“pierced body”</strong></em>.This term dates back to the Muromachi period and was created because the word <em>“kiru”</em> (to cut) was considered too unlucky to be used by anyone other than the samurai.</p>
            <p><em>Sashimi</em> is usually the first course of a formal Japanese meal, but it can also be served as a main dish, accompanied by rice and miso soup. Japanese chefs consider sashimi the finest dish at formal Japanese meals, recommending that it be eaten before other preparations with strong flavors.
            </br><br>The slices of seafood that make up the main ingredient are placed on top of a garnish. This garnish, typical in Asia, may consist of thin, long strips of white radish or various plant leaves. Sashimi is commonly served with a dipping sauce (soy sauce) and seasonings such as wasabi paste or grated ginger.</p>
